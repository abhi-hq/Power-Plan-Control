# Power-Plan-Control
Python automation script to control the system power plan based on the battery or on charge status of the system.

The code is simple if else statements and my main motive for this small project is to make it easier for me to switch between power plans, which I find myself doing a lot.

The key combinations I defined are Alt+1, Alt+2, Alt+3.

Run the code through a task scheduler and you have a working power plan control which retains the last profile you switched to for both battery and on charge state.
